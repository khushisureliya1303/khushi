<div style="height:200px;width:50%;background:#e6d583;float:left"><p>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p>

<div style="height:200px;width:50%;background:green;float:left"><p>A good example of a paragraph contains a topic sentence, details and a conclusion. 'There are many different kinds of animals that live in China. Tigers and leopards are animals that live in China's forests in the north.</p>

<div style="height:400px;width:25%;background:#fc03e3;float:left"><p>elephant</p>
<p>Elephants are large grey animals with big ears, long noses and white tusks. They are the biggest living land mammals.[1] The largest elephant recorded was shot in Angola, 1974. It weighed 27,060 lb (12.27 t) and stood 13 ft 8 in (4.17 m) tall.

At birth, an elephant calf may be as big as 100 kg (225 pounds). The baby elephant develops for 20 to 22 months inside its mother. No other land animal takes this long to develop before being born.

In the wild, elephants have strong family relationship. Their ways of acting toward other elephants are hard for people to understand. They "talk" to each other with very low sounds. Most elephants sounds are so low, people cannot hear them. But elephants can hear these sounds far away.[2] Elephants have strong, leathery skin to protect themselves.<p></div>


<div style="height:400px;width:25%;background:#8f1b2e;float:left"><p>dog</p>
<p>Dogs are mammals, usually kept as pets or for work on farms or police. Some dogs are trained to be rescue dogs, and join teams such as mountain rescue. They have been bred by humans from their ancestral wolves. They were the first animals to live with humans, as far as we know.[4]

There was a lot of variety among wolves in the Late Pleistocene.[1] The dingo is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live independently of humans in the range where they occur (parts of Australia).

Today, some dogs are used as pets, and others are used to help humans do their work. They are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal, and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets.[5] </p>

<div style="height:400px;width:25%;background:#fc03e3;float:left"><p>cow</p>
<p>Cattle (Bos taurus) are large, domesticated, bovid ungulates. They are prominent modern members of the subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. Mature female cattle are referred to as cows and mature male cattle are referred to as bulls. Colloquially, young female cattle (heifers), young male cattle (bullocks), and castrated male cattle (steers) are also referred to as "cows".

Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. They are used as riding animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements)</p></div>



<div style="height:400px;width:25%;background:#8f1b2e;float:left"><p>hipppotamus</p>
<p>The hippopotamus (/ˌhɪpəˈpɒtəməs/;[3] pl: hippopotamuses or hippopotami), also shortened to hippo (pl: hippos; Hippopotamus amphibius), further qualified as the common hippopotamus, Nile hippopotamus, or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). Its name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse" (ἱπποπόταμος).

After elephants and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the next largest land mammal. It is also the largest extant land artiodactyl. Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives of the hippopotamids are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc.) </p></div>
